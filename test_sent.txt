The automatic extraction or identification of skills from text documents such as resumes of job postings is an important task which find its application mainly in job recommender systems. However, the vast majority of existing recommendation systems first proceed by extracting skills from both resumes and job offers before applying a similarity measure to evaluate the degree of matching between the candidate profile and the skills required.
We believe that it would be more interesting to build an explainable model that would itself learn by reinforcement how to match job offers to profiles and justify its decisions by highlighting the skills identified in the profiles and their correspondence with the job offer.
